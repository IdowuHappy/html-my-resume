        <h1>My Resume</h1>
      <p>Forever greetings to whomever cares or come across this website, my website actually as it is,
        at first when i came across or rather as i got to this stage as an upcoming Web Developer, i was confused and honestly speaking became bored,
        on the other hand am not the kind of person that gives up easily,for some reason i had to relocate from where i was to another state which definitely was my state of origination (EDO STATE NIGERIA).
        Mind you am not trying to explain my story to you rather am trying to spit out my mind as an up-coming developer and aside from that am still going to communicate some stuffs about me through this website and i hope you get it all.
